# pose_graph_topologies
We release the core modules related to graph construction, head, and dataset-specific topology definitions. In addition, the configuration files of the proposed model are provided. The released modules can be directly integrated into the MMPose framework for training and evaluation. The complete engineering framework is under active preparation and will be released subsequently.
This project is built upon the MMPose framework.
We sincerely thank the OpenMMLab team for their excellent open source work.
